# Interactive 3D Cube with Button Hover Effects

This is a simple yet interactive 3D cube UI built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The cube rotates based on mouse movement and responds visually when the user hovers over "Yes" or "No" buttons.

## Features

- **Mouse-based 3D rotation** of the cube using CSS `transform` and `perspective`.
- **Dynamic color changes** on cube faces when hovering over buttons.
- Clean layout with modern UI principles.
- Fully responsive and minimal dependencies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ Semantic structure
- **CSS3** â€“ 3D Transforms, Flexbox
- **JavaScript** â€“ Event handling, dynamic DOM manipulation
